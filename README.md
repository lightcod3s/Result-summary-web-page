## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Troubleshooting the code became a frequent but valuable exercise during this project. It wasn't always easy, but I developed effective debugging strategies and learned the importance of clear code comments, ensuring smooth collaboration and future maintenance. I also expanded my web development toolkit by mastering CSS flexbox, enabling responsive and adaptable layouts.

### Continued development

While I'm comfortable using CSS flexbox, I'm curious to explore other front-end development technologies like CSS Grid. Moving forward, I aim to deepen my understanding of challenging debugging scenarios and refine my problem-solving approach. Additionally, I want to further refine my commenting skills, ensuring optimal code clarity. Mastering advanced CSS flexbox techniques to create even more dynamic and responsive layouts is also a key area of focus.


### Useful resources
